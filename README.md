## How does stopping rule matter for sex ratio?

1. Preference for male children, etc., doesn't affect the aggregate sex ratio

2. When families prefer male children but have similar preferences for family size, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of children and the proportion of male children.

3. The preference for male children and the proportion of male children is weakly correlated if people have a preference of not having too many children. But if there is a preference for very large families, e.g., 15 children, the correlation can be non-negligible (though still small). 

4. If the preference for large families is correlated with a preference for male children, the correlation between preference for male children and the proportion of male children is yet stronger.
